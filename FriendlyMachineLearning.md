## Essential Questions
- How does artificial intelligence and machine learning work?
- How can computers learn to perform a task without being explicitly program to do so?
- What does it mean that a computer "learned" something?
- How can we benefit from machine learning?
- Why is training and bias so important when training an algorithm?
- What will be the impact of having machine learning algorithms?

## Introduction
Artificial intelligence (A.I), the concept that computers can do and perform tasks that will normally require human intelligence, is becoming more and more predominant in our society. We use artificial intelligence systems almost everyday: when translating a text in the internet, when we tag our friends in Facebook or when we search for directions in a map. 

A.I requires special systems and methodologies. One very popular technique to train computers to performs tasks is machine learning. Machine learning allows computer to perform functions and jobs without explicitly programming it to do so. 

This workshop will allow students to understand the basic principles behind machine learning using live demos. It is also meant to serve as a high level introduction to topics related A.I. A friendly JavaScript web framework for machine learning will be used to show and demonstrate examples and concepts. 

### Target Audience / Prerequisite & Pre-Assessment
This is intended for high school students between 10 and 18 years old. Some familiarity with basic concepts of programming can be helpful. 

### Pacing / Duration
While this session can work as an introduction class to various machine learning concepts, ideally students can continue exploring more creative uses of machine learning.

- Break down of the class schedule example: 
  - :20 Overview, context, examples and vocabulary 
  - :30 Instruction & hands on exercise 
  - :15 Wrap-up discussion & sharing, reflection or journal and next steps

### Materials
- A computer
- Internet connection

## Outcomes & Goals
This section has three parts

#### 1) Provide an overview paragraph that describes briefly the technical concepts and skills covered in the unit;
e.g. "In this three-hour workshop, students will learn about and apply design thinking in the speculative design scenario, then translate their solutions into an interactive 2D single scene game format built in Unity. It includes an introduction to Unity and hands-on coding in Javascript."

#### 2) Vocabulary (example)
* Program: A procedure, or set of instructions, that performs a specific task when executed by a computer. 
* Programming Language: The human-readable commands and syntax (or grammar rules) used to write programs. 
      
#### 3) Prerequisites & Pre-Assessment 
Any coding languages they should already be comfortable with, any frameworks or tools they should have installed before class or any readings and exercises they should complete before class.

## Exercise Descriptions
Descriptions of each exercise or phase of class. These should be able to be broken out to be taught independently for a shorter class setting or all together for an after school program.

## Student Reflections, Takeaways & Next Steps
- Additional materials for the students to leave with that can help them dig deeper into the subject or additional exercises and challenges to help students progress their knowledge to the next leve and gain mastery of the subject through independent study.
- Multiple Project Exit Points: an idea of high-medium-low projects so students are locked into one end product.
- Presentation: how might students share their work? With peers, outside world? What media or platforms could/should be referenced to students to encourage sharing (instagram, tumblr...)? 
- Reflection: reflection questions that ask students to think about CS concepts and practices. How can students express what they’ve learned in some creative way?

## References
Include any sources cited, but not directly linked in the unit.

## Post Session, Implementation Guidance &  Teaching Reflection
e.g. Please provide some guidance based on experience delivering the unit and potential modifications might you are considering making for future iterations of this unit. This is an opportunity for you as the unit author to give teachers practical guidance.
